# video-segmentation

This is repository for my thesis project at FIT BUT.

Task was to train networks for segmentation street scenes with using information from video - in this case optical flow.

The thesis is possible to read (in CZECH) at http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/study/DP/DP.php.cs?id=19405&y=2017

# Datasets generators
- Playing for Data (bad for optical flow)
- CamVid
- Cityscapes

# Networks implemented
- SegNet basic
- ICNet
- UNet (based on Mobilenet v1)


#
Picture warping + video information is based on work
